            Prof K Viswanathan, who was part of our Mechanical engineering
            department, was a leading light and a guide for many of the students
            during his tenure. He remained an influencer and a guide even after he
            retired from the college. Through his involvement at the IRTC, he had
            stamped a strong mark in alternative and sustainable approaches to
            engineering practices.

            As a memorial to the beloved teacher, Darsana set up a technology
            corner at Palakkad district public library called Prof. K. Viswanathan
            Memorial Technology Corner. The technology corner has reference books
            in engineering, management, and related subjects. The technology
            corner was inaugurated by Mr. K.D Prasenan, (Hon. MLA Alathur
            constituency). The facility is being utilized by students across the
            district.
