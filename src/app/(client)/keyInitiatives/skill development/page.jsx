          As a part of the initiatives to help students to build rewarding
          careers, we decided to conduct a program for 45 deserving students to
          give them the skills they need and boost their self-confidence to face
          interviews. In 2008, we jointly launched this program with the college's
          placement cell, and the students responded positively. The skill
          development program has grown significantly over time.
